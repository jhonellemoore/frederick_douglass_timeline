1818,2,14,1823,,,,Douglas born and raised with grandma betsy,"Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, who would later become known as Frederick Douglass, was born into slavery in February 1818 at Holme Hill Farm, on Tuckahoe Creek in Talbot County, Maryland. His exact birth date is unknown, but Douglass chose to celebrate his birthday on February 14th each year.

Frederick’s mother, Harriet Bailey, was an enslaved woman who had seven children, including Frederick. Due to her being hired out to other plantations, she rarely saw Frederick, making long nighttime journeys on foot to visit him briefly. He recalled:

""I never saw my mother to know her as such more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was short in duration and at night…She made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her day’s work…I do not recollect ever seeing my mother by the light of day.""

His father was a white man, rumored to be Aaron Anthony, the overseer of the plantation where Frederick spent his early childhood.

Frederick was raised by his grandmother Betsy and had three older siblings—Perry, Sarah, and Eliza. ",,,,,,,
1824,2,14,1826,,,,Douglass grows up on the lloyd plantation as a slave,"At around six years old, Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was sent to live on the Lloyd plantation, located on the Wye River in Talbot County, Maryland. The Lloyds were one of the wealthiest families in the state, and the Georgian-style Wye House Mansion, built in 1785 by Edward Lloyd IV, was an imposing symbol of their wealth and power. It was here that Frederick met his three older siblings, Perry, Sarah, and Eliza, for the first time, along with six of his cousins.

The Lloyd plantation was home to several groups of people. Among them were the enslaved black children, overseen by Aunt Katy, a harsh woman who worked in the household. The other key inhabitants were Aaron Anthony’s family, which included his two sons and daughter, Lucretia. Lucretia was married to Thomas Auld, the captain of Colonel Lloyd’s sloop.

During his time at the plantation, Frederick formed a close friendship with Daniel Lloyd, the son of Colonel Edward Lloyd, the plantation owner. This relationship offered Frederick a rare, if brief, connection to someone outside the world of slavery. During this period, Frederick's mother dies and aunt Jenny and uncle Noah escape to freedom.",,,,,,,
1826,,,1831,11,,,Douglass is introduced to reading and national literature. ,"At around eight years old, Frederick Douglass was sent to Baltimore to live with Hugh Auld, the brother of Thomas Auld, and his family (sophia auld and son). His role was to be a companion for Hugh’s young son, Tommy Auld. They lived around Philpot Street, in a bustling neighborhood of Baltimore. During this period, the city was booming with activity from trading and shipbuilding, and the cornerstone for the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Railroad had just been laid, signaling a new era of transportation and commerce. Baltimore also had the largest concentration of free Black people in the United States at that time, offering Frederick a glimpse into a different world.

While at the Auld household, Frederick encountered a pivotal influence in his life—Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife. Initially, she began teaching him the alphabet and basic reading skills. However, when her husband discovered this, he rebuked her, asserting that educating enslaved people would make them ""unfit"" for bondage. This incident had a profound impact on Frederick. Although Sophia stopped her lessons, the seed was planted, and he realized that literacy was the key to freedom.

Determined to learn despite the restrictions, Frederick began to teach himself to read. He befriended local white boys on Philpot Street, such as Gustavus Dorgan, Joseph Bailey, Charles Farity, and William Cosdry, often outsmarting and tricking them into teaching him new words. He used every opportunity to advance his knowledge, sometimes exchanging bread for reading lessons. These small acts of defiance became the foundation of his education.

During this time, Frederick managed to obtain a copy of The Columbian Orator, a popular anthology featuring essays, speeches, and dialogues by influential thinkers such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Cato, and Daniel O’Connell. This book became his prized possession and a significant source of inspiration. The dialogues in The Columbian Orator often featured philosophical arguments on freedom and human rights, including one particularly impactful conversation between a slave and his master, in which the enslaved man persuades the master to grant him freedom.

Through these readings, Frederick was introduced to ideas of abolition, moral philosophy, and the possibility of self-emancipation. He also began questioning the justifications of slavery and contemplating the concepts of free will versus predestination. These early experiences in Baltimore marked the beginning of his transformation from an oppressed child into an empowered young man determined to seek freedom and justice.",,,,,,,
1831,,,1833,,,,"Douglass turns christian, learns how to write","During his time in Baltimore, Frederick Douglass became increasingly aware of the social and political tensions surrounding slavery. He overheard discussions about the Nat Turner Rebellion, a violent uprising of enslaved people in Virginia in 1831, which captured his imagination and heightened his awareness of resistance and the fight for freedom. 

As Douglass continued to grow in this environment, he became fascinated with preachers and orators. He listened to the words of white ministers, such as Sophia Auld’s pastor, Reverend Beverly Waugh, and Reverend Hanson. His spiritual journey took a significant turn when he met Charles Johnson, a Black lay preacher. Johnson taught him how to pray and introduced him to a personal, intimate form of faith. It was through Johnson that Douglass experienced his first religious conversion. Later, Douglass encountered another pivotal figure in his life: Charles Lawson, an elderly Black man who became a mentor and a second father figure to him. Lawson took Douglass under his wing and emphasized that God had “a great work” for him to do. 

Douglass’s journey in learning how to write was also interesting. He taught himself how to write by studying the pieces of wood that carpenters were hewing into ship timbers, memorizing the letters and words they carved. Douglass also obtained various texts, including a Webster Spelling Book, The Columbian Orator, the Bible, and a Methodist hymnbook. ",,,,,,,
1833,,,1834,,,,Witnesses religious hypocrisy and stands up to a slave beater,"In 1833, Frederick Douglass was abruptly torn from his relatively freer life in Baltimore and sent back to Talbot County, Maryland, to live with Thomas Auld.  He now lived in St. Michaels under the rule of Thomas Auld.

Douglass quickly noticed the hypocrisy of Auld, who claimed to have undergone a religious conversion at a Methodist camp meeting in 1833. Despite his newfound faith, Auld remained as cruel as ever. He would attend church and profess piety on Sundays, but by Monday, he was back to his usual harsh self—starving his workers, handing out brutal punishments, and denying them basic necessities. For Douglass, Auld’s behavior exemplified the worst kind of religious hypocrisy.

During his time at Auld’s, Douglass began to teach other enslaved people how to read. He secretly convened meetings at the home of a free Black man named James Mitchell, where he ran a  Sabbath school. He also began challenging Thomas Auld more openly. On different occasions, he refused to work and confronted Auld.  Auld decided to “break” him by sending him to Edward Covey, a notorious “slave breaker”.

Covey beat Douglass frequently, using cowskin whips, sticks, and any other instrument at hand to inflict pain and enforce obedience. One day, after enduring months of abuse, while covey beats him for his exhaustion, Douglass stands up to Covey and fights back, and attrivutes this fight to one of the most impactful moments of self-respect and a spirit of freedom.",,,,,,,
